# Gortex Code Intelligence

Gortex is running as an MCP server. It indexes this repository into an in-memory knowledge graph and exposes tools for code navigation, impact analysis, and refactoring.

## Use Gortex tools instead of file reads whenever possible

### Navigation and Reading

| Instead of...                         | Use...                                   |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Reading a whole file for one function | ` + "`get_symbol_source`" + ` with ` + "`id: \"path/to/file.go::SymbolName\"`" + ` (80% fewer tokens) — use ` + "`get_file_summary`" + ` first if you don't know the symbol name |
| Reading to find a function            | ` + "`get_symbol`" + ` or ` + "`get_editing_context`" + `    |
| Multiple ` + "`get_symbol`" + ` calls           | ` + "`batch_symbols`" + ` (one call for N symbols) |
| Searching for references              | ` + "`find_usages`" + ` (zero false positives)     |
| Searching to find a symbol by name    | ` + "`search_symbols`" + ` (BM25 + camelCase)      |
| Filtering ` + "`search_symbols`" + ` by hand    | ` + "`winnow_symbols`" + ` — structured constraint chain (kind, language, community, path_prefix, min_fan_in, min_churn) with per-axis score contributions |
| Reading to understand a file          | ` + "`get_file_summary`" + ` or ` + "`get_editing_context`" + ` |
| Reading multiple files to trace calls | ` + "`get_call_chain`" + ` / ` + "`get_callers`" + `         |
| Guessing an import path              | ` + "`find_import_path`" + `                       |
| Reading to check a function signature | ` + "`get_symbol_signature`" + `                   |
| 5-10 calls to explore for a task      | ` + "`smart_context`" + ` (one call)               |

### Impact Analysis and Safety

| Instead of...                         | Use...                                   |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Reading files to assess change scope  | ` + "`explain_change_impact`" + ` (includes cross-community warnings) |
| Guessing which tests to run           | ` + "`get_test_targets`" + `                       |
| Manual dependency ordering            | ` + "`get_edit_plan`" + `                          |
| Hoping signature changes are safe     | ` + "`verify_change`" + ` — checks callers and interface implementors |
| Manually checking team conventions    | ` + "`check_guards`" + ` — evaluates guard rules from .gortex.yaml |
| Wondering if a new dep creates a cycle| ` + "`analyze`" + ` with ` + "`kind: \"would_create_cycle\"`" + ` — checks before you add it |

### Structural Code Search

| Instead of...                            | Use...                                   |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Grep for an anti-pattern in this repo    | ` + "`search_ast`" + ` with ` + "`detector: \"<name>\"`" + ` (` + "`error-not-wrapped`" + ` / ` + "`sql-string-concat`" + ` / ` + "`weak-crypto`" + ` / ` + "`panic-in-library`" + ` / ` + "`goroutine-without-recover`" + ` / ` + "`http-client-no-timeout`" + ` / ` + "`hardcoded-secret`" + ` / ` + "`empty-catch`" + ` / ` + "`java-string-equality`" + ` / ` + "`python-mutable-default-arg`" + `). Cross-language; matches enriched with enclosing ` + "`symbol_id`" + `. |
| Grep for a code shape                    | ` + "`search_ast`" + ` with ` + "`pattern: \"...\"`" + ` + ` + "`language`" + ` (tree-sitter S-expression; capture with ` + "`@name`" + `, anchor with ` + "`@match`" + `). |
| Scoping audit to important code          | Pass ` + "`min_fan_in_of_enclosing_func: <N>`" + ` — drops matches in functions with fewer than N callers. |

### Diagnostics and Code Actions

| Instead of...                            | Use...                                   |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Polling for diagnostics after every edit | ` + "`subscribe_diagnostics`" + ` — opt into push ` + "`notifications/diagnostics`" + `. Initial state replays as ` + "`initial_replay: true`" + `; thereafter delta-changed files only. ` + "`min_severity`" + ` / ` + "`path_prefix`" + ` filters scope the stream. |
| Manual diagnostics fetch                 | ` + "`get_diagnostics`" + ` — last stored ` + "`publishDiagnostics`" + ` for a file; ` + "`wait`" + ` + ` + "`timeout_ms`" + ` block until the first publish. |
| Forgetting to opt out                    | ` + "`unsubscribe_diagnostics`" + ` — idempotent; auto-fires on session disconnect. |
| Hand-applying compiler suggestions       | ` + "`get_code_actions`" + ` then ` + "`apply_code_action`" + ` (atomic temp+rename, both ` + "`changes`" + ` and ` + "`documentChanges`" + `). |
| Walking a file to apply every fix        | ` + "`fix_all_in_file`" + ` — one-shot ` + "`source.fixAll`" + ` for the whole file. |

### Code Quality and Analysis

| Instead of...                         | Use...                                   |

| Surveying K8s manifests in the repo   | ` + "`analyze`" + ` with ` + "`kind: \"k8s_resources\"`" + ` — KindResource fan-out (depends_on / configures / mounts / exposes / uses_env); ` + "`k8s_kind`" + ` / ` + "`namespace`" + ` / ` + "`name`" + ` filters |
| Listing container images in use       | ` + "`analyze`" + ` with ` + "`kind: \"images\"`" + ` — KindImage with consumer count (Dockerfile FROM + K8s ` + "`container.image`" + `); ` + "`role`" + ` / ` + "`ref`" + ` / ` + "`tag`" + ` filters |
| Mapping the Kustomize overlay tree    | ` + "`analyze`" + ` with ` + "`kind: \"kustomize\"`" + ` — KindKustomization with base / resource fan-out; ` + "`dir`" + ` filter |

### Clone Detection

| Instead of...                         | Use...                                   |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Eyeballing the repo for copy-paste    | ` + "`find_clones`" + ` — near-duplicate function/method clusters from the ` + "`similar_to`" + ` graph layer (MinHash + LSH; catches renamed-variable clones) |
| Finding safe-to-delete duplicates     | ` + "`find_clones`" + ` with ` + "`dead_only: true`" + ` — clusters containing a dead-code symbol ("dead duplicates of live code") |

### Multi-Repo Management

| Instead of...                         | Use...                                   |

| Scoping a query to a project          | Pass ` + "`project`" + ` param to any query tool |
| Filtering by reference tag            | Pass ` + "`ref`" + ` param to any query tool |

## Session workflow

1. Call ` + "`graph_stats`" + ` to confirm Gortex is running. If ` + "`total_nodes`" + ` is 0, call ` + "`index_repository`" + ` with path ` + "`\".\"`" + `.
2. In multi-repo mode, call ` + "`get_active_project`" + ` to check scope. Use ` + "`set_active_project`" + ` to switch if needed.
3. For a new task, call ` + "`smart_context`" + ` with the task description.
4. Before editing any file, call ` + "`get_editing_context`" + ` first.
5. Before changing a function signature, call ` + "`verify_change`" + ` to catch contract violations — checks callers across all repos.
6. Before any refactor, call ` + "`get_edit_plan`" + ` for dependency-ordered file list. Use ` + "`batch_edit`" + ` to apply atomically.
7. After editing, call ` + "`check_guards`" + ` to verify team conventions, then ` + "`get_test_targets`" + ` for tests to run (includes cross-repo test files).
8. Before committing, call ` + "`detect_changes`" + ` to verify scope. Use ` + "`diff_context`" + ` for graph-enriched review.

# Exploring Codebases with Gortex

## Workflow

1. ` + "`graph_stats`" + ` — confirm index, get node/edge counts
2. ` + "`get_communities`" + ` — see functional clusters (architecture overview)
3. ` + "`search_symbols({query: \"<concept>\"})`" + ` — find symbols related to a concept
4. ` + "`get_processes`" + ` — discover execution flows
5. ` + "`get_process({id: \"<process-id>\"})`" + ` — trace a specific flow step by step
6. ` + "`get_editing_context({path: \"<file>\"})`" + ` — deep dive on a specific file

## When to use

- "How does authentication work?"
- "What's the project structure?"
- "Show me the main components"
- Understanding code you haven't seen before

## Key tools

- ` + "`get_communities`" + ` for architectural overview (functional clusters with cohesion scores)
- ` + "`get_processes`" + ` for execution flow discovery (entry points to call chains)
- ` + "`search_symbols`" + ` for concept-based symbol search (BM25 + camelCase-aware)
- ` + "`get_editing_context`" + ` for 360-degree file view (symbols, callers, callees, imports)

# Debugging with Gortex

## Workflow

1. ` + "`search_symbols({query: \"<error or suspect>\"})`" + ` — find related symbols
2. ` + "`get_callers({id: \"<suspect>\"})`" + ` — who calls it?
3. ` + "`get_call_chain({id: \"<suspect>\"})`" + ` — what does it call?
4. ` + "`get_editing_context({path: \"<file>\"})`" + ` — full file context
5. ` + "`get_process({id: \"<process>\"})`" + ` — trace execution flow

## Debugging patterns

| Symptom              | Gortex Approach |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| Error message        | ` + "`search_symbols`" + ` for error-related names, then ` + "`get_callers`" + ` on throw sites |
| Wrong return value   | ` + "`get_call_chain`" + ` on the function, trace callees for data flow |
| Intermittent failure | ` + "`get_editing_context`" + `, look for external calls and async deps |
| Performance issue    | ` + "`find_usages`" + `, find symbols with many callers (hot paths) |
| Recent regression    | ` + "`detect_changes`" + `, see what your changes affect |

# Impact Analysis with Gortex

## Workflow

1. ` + "`search_symbols({query: \"X\"})`" + ` — find the symbol ID
2. ` + "`explain_change_impact({ids: \"<id1>, <id2>\"})`" + ` — risk-tiered blast radius
3. ` + "`get_dependents({id: \"<symbol-id>\", depth: 3})`" + ` — detailed dependent tree
4. ` + "`detect_changes({scope: \"staged\"})`" + ` — pre-commit check

## Risk tiers

| Depth | Risk Level     | Meaning                  |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| d=1   | WILL BREAK     | Direct callers/importers |
| d=2   | LIKELY AFFECTED| Indirect dependencies    |
| d=3   | MAY NEED TESTING| Transitive effects      |

## Before any non-trivial change

- Call ` + "`explain_change_impact`" + ` with all symbols you plan to modify
- Review the risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
- Check ` + "`by_depth`" + `: d=1 items WILL BREAK
- Note ` + "`affected_processes`" + ` and ` + "`affected_communities`" + `
- Check ` + "`test_files`" + ` that need re-running
- Before commit: ` + "`detect_changes`" + ` to verify scope

# Refactoring with Gortex

## Workflow

1. ` + "`search_symbols({query: \"X\"})`" + ` — find the symbol ID
2. ` + "`explain_change_impact({ids: \"<id>\"})`" + ` — map blast radius
3. ` + "`get_editing_context({path: \"<file>\"})`" + ` — see all symbols and relationships
4. ` + "`find_usages({id: \"<id>\"})`" + ` — every reference to change
5. ` + "`get_edit_plan({ids: \"<ids>\"})`" + ` — dependency-ordered edit sequence
6. Edit in order: interfaces -> implementations -> callers -> tests
7. ` + "`detect_changes({scope: \"all\"})`" + ` — verify after changes

## Rename symbol

- ` + "`find_usages`" + ` to get every reference location
- ` + "`explain_change_impact`" + ` to assess blast radius
- Edit in dependency order: definition, then callers, then tests

## Extract module

- ` + "`get_editing_context`" + ` on the source file to see all symbols
- ` + "`get_dependents`" + ` on symbols to extract to find external callers
- ` + "`find_import_path`" + ` for correct import paths in the new location

## Split function/service

- ` + "`get_call_chain`" + ` to understand all callees
- ` + "`get_callers`" + ` to map all call sites that need updating
- ` + "`explain_change_impact`" + ` for full blast radius
